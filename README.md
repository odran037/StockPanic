The api key is in a .env file:
`REACT_APP_API_KEY=********************`

Let me know if you want to use my key and I'll send it over.

Thank you all for the opportunity to make it this far in the process. This was 
a very fun challenge to work on. I did my best to utilize this weekend to work
on this challenge. But unfortunately due to some unforeseen circumstances I
could not spend as much time as I would have liked over this weekend to
accomplish everything I wanted to.

I'm content with the result and intentionally designed the layout as you see
instead of separating everything into 3 pages as specified in the Epic.

I intended to use a much more elaborate graphic, however I'm not at all familiar
with D3.js. I found a sample to use from https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts
But due to time constraints I was only able to get something working with one
the more minimal charts. I'm not sure if whoever runs the code will be able
to notice that the websocket does make the chart fluctuate, after a while I was
getting errors from the websocket api:

`Websocket connection to 'wss://ws.finnhub.io?token=********************' failed: Unknown reason`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things I would have wanted to do:

- Write unit tests
- Create my own, completely custom graph
- Spend more time with the 'finnhub' api to have more elaborate information and maybe added features.
- Add react-router to separate views and add redux to better share data between views

I hope you all like what I've done even if it isn't as good as I would have wanted. I know
I had until Tuesday to turn it in but I won't have time today (Monday) to work on it more
due to my current job.

If there are any comments and criticisms, I'd love to hear it. And if there are
any questions I'd be happy to clarify anything.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Again, thank you very much for the opportunity to have gotten this far.
